# ROBOT-localization-using-Hidden-Markov-Model-

The objective of this project is divided into two distinct parts. In the first part, our aim is to predict the location of a robot using hidden Markov models. In the second part, our focus shifts to evaluating the remaining lifespan of the robot. To achieve this, we gather location and lifespan data from the robot's sensors and use it to train our model. The hidden Markov model allows us to consider the hidden states of the system, such as potential robot failures, which impact its location and remaining lifespan.

Once our model is properly trained, we apply it to make predictions about the current location of the robot and its remaining lifespan. Our approach also involves putting theoretical results into practice by exploring the essential tools and technologies needed for the implementation of our system. In this regard, we concentrate on two key aspects: hardware, detailing the physical components used, and software, presenting the associated computer programs.

In conclusion, the obtained results will be used to enhance the planning and maintenance of the robot, as well as to increase its operational efficiency.
